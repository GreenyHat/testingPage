## Star Wars fan page project:

In this repository, I will build the basic structure for a fictional Spanish star wars fan blog where I tell the story of the group, how they became a company and what they sell. The purpose of this is as follows:

put into use the knowledge acquired in html and css in the development module of cross-platform applications, as well as to improve my ability to search for resources on the internet

## Architecture

> Architecture diagram goes here. Use the following format:

![Diagram of the <AFS_Page> architecture.](test\SCHEMA.drawio.png)

> Under the architecture diagram, include this sentence and a link to the page: 

*Click in [this link](https://greenyhat.github.io/StarWars/index.html) to see the basic architecture. In the future I will be updated
*


## Next steps

- Improve css aspects
- Insert dynamic elements
- Links shouldn't include "en-us" locale unless they don't work without it.
- Documentation links should be relative, such as (/azure/feature/article-name).
- Don't include a trailing slash in any links.
